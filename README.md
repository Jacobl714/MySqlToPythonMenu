# MySqlToPythonMenu

This python program connects to a COMPANY Databse with tables including EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS, etc.  It allows for users with no MySQL knowledge to modify a database.  When run, it generates a menu to allow users to do the following functions:
  1. Add new employee
  2. View existing employee
  3. Modify employee
  4. Remove employee
  5. Add new dependent
  6. Remove dependent
  7. Add new department
  8. View department
  9. Remove department
  10. Add department location
  11. Remove department location

This was a fun project that allowed me to mess around with both python and MySQL.
